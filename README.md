# What's quantum computing?
quantum computing is about using machines that has qubits instead of bits.
# What's the difference?
Classical computers (like ours) use regular bits to operate, that means that transistors contain either hight voltage for 1 or low voltage for 0.
However, in quantum computers we use a quantum bit that applies the superposition principle for its value.That means, while left **unobserved** it will have all its possible states (1 and 0)which means that it has both values at the same time!
[Here's a link that explains a little bit more a bout it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28)  
In this project , you will see a simple demonstration about using qubits instead of normal bits.
